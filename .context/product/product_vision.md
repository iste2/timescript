# TimeScript Product Vision

## Overview

TimeScript is a tool that turns descriptions of work days in natural language into formatted outputs that can be entered into any time tracking system or time clock system. It bridges the gap between how people naturally describe their work and the structured data requirements of time tracking systems.

## Vision Statement

To simplify time tracking by allowing users to describe their work in natural language and automatically converting it into the precise format required by their time tracking systems.

## Problem Statement

Traditional time tracking systems require users to:

- Remember exact project codes, task numbers, and categories
- Structure their time entries in rigid formats
- Switch between different interfaces and workflows
- Manually format data for different systems

This creates friction and reduces the accuracy and completeness of time tracking.

## Solution

TimeScript provides an intelligent interface that:

- Accepts natural language descriptions of work activities
- Learns user patterns and preferences
- Converts descriptions into structured, formatted outputs
- Adapts to any time tracking system's requirements

## Core Features

### 1. Natural Language Processing

- **Free Chat Interface**: Users can have conversational interactions with the AI agent to refine and clarify their time entries
- **Flexible Input**: Accept informal, imprecise descriptions and intelligently interpret them
- **Context Awareness**: Understand work patterns and context to fill in missing details

### 2. Task & Project Management

- **Task Definition**: Define and manage common tasks with associated metadata
- **Project Numbers**: Maintain project codes and accounting numbers for automatic assignment
- **Category Mapping**: Map natural language descriptions to formal project categories

### 3. Productivity Shortcuts

- **Slash Commands**: Predefined commands for quick date entry and common actions
  - `/today` - Set current date
  - `/yesterday` - Set previous day
  - `/week` - Set current week
  - Custom date shortcuts
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provide intelligent autocomplete based on user history

### 4. Templates System

- **Custom Templates**: Define slash commands that expand into common task descriptions
- **Reusable Patterns**: Create templates for frequently performed work
- **Variable Substitution**: Templates can include placeholders for dynamic content

### 5. Flexible Output Schema

- **Configurable Formats**: Define any output schema needed for specific time tracking systems
- **Multiple Formats**: Support CSV, JSON, XML, or custom formats
- **System Integration**: Pre-built templates for popular time tracking systems

## User Experience Goals

- **Effortless Entry**: Make time tracking feel natural and conversational
- **Accurate Conversion**: Ensure high accuracy in translating natural language to structured data
- **Quick Correction**: Easy refinement and correction of AI interpretations
- **Consistent Output**: Reliable, properly formatted results every time

## Technical Architecture

- **AI-Powered**: Leverages natural language processing for intelligent interpretation
- **Configurable**: Highly customizable to adapt to different workflows and systems
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for adding new time tracking system integrations

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in time spent on time tracking activities
- Increased accuracy and completeness of time entries
- User satisfaction with natural language interface
- Successful integration with existing time tracking workflows

## Future Enhancements

- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text capabilities for hands-free entry
